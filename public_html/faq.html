                The default buttons are the left and right mouse buttons and the Z and X buttons, which can be modified
                in the settings.
                The discs that appear on the game screen are called strike circles. When the circle outside the circle
                shrinks and just falls on the circle, click the circle.
                Some percussion rings have a slider, you need to hold down the percussion ring and follow it.
                When a large disk appears on the screen, press and hold the button to quickly rotate around the center
                of the circle.

                <h2>The cursor movement and/or clicking seems to be delayed? </h2>
                Try to enable the hardware cursor in the settings, which can reduce the delay of cursor feedback.
                However, in some operating systems or browsers, problems such as flickering or inability to display the
                cursor may occur, so it is turned off by default. In addition, the current cursor size adjustment of the
                hardware cursor is only fixed to 3 levels, the smallest value is displayed below 0.65, and the largest
                value is displayed above 0.95.

                <h2>The game is very glitchy and freezes, what should I do? </h2>
                You can uncheck "Use system resolution" in the settings and set the resolution to a value lower than the
                system zoom (the computer system zoom for laptops or high-resolution screens usually exceeds 100%). It
                is recommended to avoid high CPU usage, close anti-virus software, try to
                close other tabs of the browser and restart the browser. Please make sure you are using a mainstream
                modern browser (such as Firefox, Chrome). If it is still stuck, please <a

                <h2>Why is nothing displayed on the webpage? </h2>
                It may be that the mirror station that provides the chart is wrong. You can find that there is no
                content on the mirror site <a href="https://osu.sayobot.cn/">Sayobot</a>. If this is the case,
                you can contact the webmaster of the mirror site to restore it.
